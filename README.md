## Presentation

TACOS is the mobile application by [CASES](https://www.cases.lu).  
Our intention simple. We want to put a little more security in your smartphone
(**or pocket ?**).

TACOS is primarily an awareness app for cybersecurity. But we also included some
tools like a password cards generator and a spam signal functionality.
And some little games for the fun.


## Features

- tips and tricks.
- awareness videos by CASES;
- games and quiz to learn the basics of cybersecurity hygiene;
- manage your password cards (digital version of the CASES password card
  **do we have a link for that ?**);
- spam signal. Check for spam phone numbers from your incoming calls.
  Our database of spam is feeded thanks to
  [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP). You can also contribute
  to our database by reporting spam phone numbers;
- security news feeds currated by the CASES team.
