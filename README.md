## Presentation

TACOS is the mobile application by [CASES](https://www.cases.lu).  

TACOS provides a spam detection feature. It allows you to check for spam phone
numbers from your incoming calls. Our database of spam is built among other
thanks to the [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP) project.
Of course you can also contribute to our database by reporting spam phone
numbers.

Besides that, TACOS is also an awareness application for cybersecurity.
We included some tools like a password cards generator, some security and
privacy awareness games.
